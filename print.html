<p>This technical primer aims to deliver technically resourceful information such as the approaches, models, frameworks &amp; design patterns used to develop the KIP network &amp; its underlying services. The paper elaborates on the technical design contrast between existing prominent blockchains, distributed file storage systems &amp; KIP's digital mesh of the 3rd generation blockchain realms, storage realms along with business-front services.</p>
<a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>Recent trends and innovation in the blockchain &amp; distributed file storage systems has tremendously impacted the landscape of research in distributed systems.
More sane &amp; understandable consensus algorithms, node management, optimized file write &amp; retrieval techniques have been churned out in the past few years. However, most of them do not seem to have a great fit with the enterprise ecosystem as the deign rationale behind such innovations were mostly intended for a fully decentralized and transparent world.</p>
<p>KIP resolves this gap by converging Intelligence, Connectedness and Trust (the new ICT!) to create a fundamental digital fabric on which new digital services can be directly built using distributed intelligence.</p>
<a class="header" href="#existing-systems" id="existing-systems"><h3>Existing systems</h3></a>
<p>The third generation of web is comprised of multi-faceted technologies with some of the stacks synonymous to an entire domain. KIP assumes a few stacks in the forefront of development as the source of research for contrast and design resolution.</p>

<ul>
<li>We propose a composite system with extended abilities to support better network attributes by approaching existing limitations with sentinel scalability, modulated trust, and actor-based throughput.</li>
<li>The proposed system extends the value measuring capabilities in a blockchain-alike transactional environment with Total Digital Utility(TDU) scores.</li>
<li>Also, the economical uncertainty in performing transactions on the blockchain is addressed by the method of stable gas costing mechanism.</li>

<p>We discuss each of approaches here in detail:</p>
<a class="header" href="#sentinel-scalability" id="sentinel-scalability"><h3>Sentinel Scalability</h3></a>
<p>KIP leverages TARA(Ternary Augmented Raft Architecture)<sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>, an enhanced version of RAFT<sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup> algorithm, for high-frequency consensus, simplified service discovery &amp; dynamic node management.</p>
<p>TARA provides multi-faceted abilities to manage a network of distributed systems by managing nodes in a graph format. Analogous to vertices connected acyclically by drawing edges in a graph, nodes are connected by an RPC(Remote Procedure Call)<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup> connection between them. The RPC connections establish a network in a hybrid manner.</p>
<p>Each node in the KIP system is defined in the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">
type Node struct {
    state    NodeState		// Whether an Orphan, Follower, Candidate OR a Leader
    role     NodeRole		// Whether is under service, star or master subnet

    eventmux *event.TypeMux // Event multiplexer used between the services of a stack
    config   *Config
    accman   *accounts.Manager

    ephemeralKeystore string         // if non-empty, the key directory that will be removed by Stop
    instanceDirLock   flock.Releaser // prevents concurrent use of instance directory

    serverConfig p2p.Config
    server       *p2p.Server // Currently running P2P networking layer

    serviceFuncs []ServiceConstructor     // Service constructors (in dependency order)
    services     map[reflect.Type]Service // Currently running services

    rpcAPIs       []rpc.API   // List of APIs currently provided by the node
    inprocHandler *rpc.Server // In-process RPC request handler to process the API requests

    ipcEndpoint string       // IPC endpoint to listen at (empty = IPC disabled)
    ipcListener net.Listener // IPC RPC listener socket to serve API requests
    ipcHandler  *rpc.Server  // IPC RPC request handler to process the API requests

    httpEndpoint  string       // HTTP endpoint (interface + port) to listen at (empty = HTTP disabled)
    httpWhitelist []string     // HTTP RPC modules to allow through this endpoint
    httpListener  net.Listener // HTTP RPC listener socket to server API requests
    httpHandler   *rpc.Server  // HTTP RPC request handler to process the API requests

    wsEndpoint string       // Websocket endpoint (interface + port) to listen at (empty = websocket disabled)
    wsListener net.Listener // Websocket RPC listener socket to server API requests
    wsHandler  *rpc.Server  // Websocket RPC request handler to process the API requests

    stop chan struct{} // Channel to wait for termination notifications
    lock sync.RWMutex
}

</code></pre>
<p>wherein the state and mode attributes are enumerated as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">
type NodeState int32

const (
    ORPHAN    NodeState = 0
    FOLLOWER  NodeState = 1
    CANDIDATE NodeState = 2
    LEADER    NodeState = 3
)
var NodeStateMap map[common.Hash]uint


type NodeRole int32

const (
    IDLE_ROLE    NodeMode = 0
    SERVICE_ROLE NodeMode = 1
    STAR_ROLE    NodeMode = 2
    GRAND_ROLE   NodeMode = 3
)
var NodeRoleMap map[common.Hash]uint

</code></pre>
<p>TARA, based on PBFT hardened RAFT facilitates the network with addition and removal of nodes in a dynamic manner. A formal specifications for the same here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">
func ParseNode(string enodeURL) {
    // Parse node info by its enode:/// URL
}

func addPeer(Node node) {
    // Add the peer into a specific network
}

func (n *Node) setPeerRole() error {
    // Update the status of the node under its type definition
}

func (n *Node) getPeerRole() error {
    // Get the current role of the specified node by its type definition
}

func removePeer(Node node) {
    //  Remove the node from the specified network &amp; revoke all access
}

</code></pre>
<p>TARA leverages raftpb<sup><a href="#references">[6]</a></sup> - The Protobuf<sup><a href="#references">[7]</a></sup> implementation for RAFT from CoreOS' etcd<sup><a href="#references">[8]</a></sup> package to manage &amp; broadcast network level changes due to addition or removal of peers.</p>
<p><img src="images/tech-primer/KIP-Sentinel-Scalability.png" alt="KIP Sentinel Scalability" /></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Fig 1:</b> KIP - Sentinel Scalability and node management with NTQ <sup><a href="#references"></a></sup> </p>
<p>KIP's approach to achieving sentinel scalability is by observing the interest of the new nodes joining the network, hosted by interested parties called <em>verifiers</em>. Each node is vetted for reliability &amp; commercial viability by a benchmarking program that receives the above mentioned interests as input from the owners of the node.</p>
<p>KIP's node benchmark program calculates the reliability based on 2 criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware specifications:</strong><br />
The program collects the host's following hardware information:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU's architecture,</li>
<li>Number of CPU(s),</li>
<li>Thread(s) per core,</li>
<li>CPU's frequency,</li>
<li>MIPS,</li>
<li>Total cache size,</li>
<li>Total main memory,</li>
<li>Available space in the reserved partition,</li>
<li>OS type &amp; version, and</li>
<li>Kernel build</li>
</ul>
<p>The collected attribute values are aggregated to find the mean score, upon which the node is declared valid under a tier or vice-versa.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Description 4.1:</strong></p>
<p>$$
\Delta
$$</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Network Specifications:</strong><br />
The benchmark programs then communicates with the node by sending a specific number of arbitrary messages in an encapsulated virtual network to calculate the responsive potential of the node. The measured throughput is compared with the average throughput of all the nodes in the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Description 4.2:</strong></p>
<p>$$
\Delta
$$</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Interest Verification:</strong><br />
The benchmark program also keeps track of the transactions verified by the node for a brief period of time. The monitoring is kept under observation to reserve the interest of the new node in the network &amp; to eliminate bad actor interests from the network. The aggregate of number of transactions dropped over the time observed is compared for shaping the Node Trust Quotient (NTQ) in full.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Description 4.3:</strong></p>
<p>$$
\Delta
$$</p>
<p>Upon passing the specification tests, the eligible nodes joining the KIP network is considered &quot;orphan&quot; role with only an ability to become a member of the shadow pool verifying shadow broadcasts, until the KIP's network orchestrator adds the peer into a state channel. Once the node is added into a state channel, the node is assigned the &quot;Follower&quot; role &amp; hence entitled to verify the transactions passed on to its state channels. However, all follower nodes belonging to arbitrary state channels are also responsible for verifying the transactions propagated in the shadow broadcasts shared by the grand leader.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Node Lifecycle - Formal Notation:</strong></p>

<p>KIP's approach to achieving sentinel scalability is by observing the interest of the new nodes joining the network, hosted by interested parties called <em>verifiers</em>. Each node is vetted for reliability &amp; commercial viability by a benchmarking program that receives the above mentioned interests as input from the owners of the node.</p>
<p>KIP's node benchmark program calculates the reliability based on 2 criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware specifications:</strong><br />
The program collects the host's following hardware information:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU's architecture,</li>
<li>Number of CPU(s),</li>

Once the node is added into a state channel, the node is assigned the &quot;Follower&quot; role &amp; hence entitled to verify the transactions passed on to its state channels. However, all follower nodes belonging to arbitrary state channels are also responsible for verifying the transactions propagated in the shadow broadcasts shared by the grand leader.</p>

<a class="header" href="#modulated-trust" id="modulated-trust"><h3>Modulated Trust</h3></a>
<p>KIP leverages the concept of selective hearing<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup> in the network to facilitate modulated trust. The concept of state channels presented in this paper is different from the concepts used by the ethereum &amp; other blockchain networks to address throughput. Selective hearing in distributed computing network is a well-practiced to address the interest of a sub set of nodes responsible for persisting / operating the relevant information.</p>
<p>Similarly, enterprise stakeholders in a heterogenous business network operate to persist transactional information that favours their respective success. The &quot;single floor communication&quot; philosophy adopted by blockchain has been observed as a challenge, to differentiate priorities between verifying transactions pertaining to lower &amp; relatively higher asset values.</p>
<p><img src="images/tech-primer/KIP-Modulated-Trust.png" alt="KIP Modulated Trust" /></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Fig 2:</b> KIP - Modulated Trust & NTQ-based state channel approach <sup><a href="#references"></a></sup> </p>
<p>KIP maintains the credibility of the verifying nodes by aggregating the performance &amp; behavior of the nodes and attributing it to NTQ - Node Trust Quotient.
Each new node added into the KIP network is automatically assigned the role of an orphan. The node is vetted by requesting for vesting a finite number of KIP Tokens as well as uptime to confirm transactions of sorts in the shadow pool for a finite period of time.</p>
<p>As the node gets attributed with sufficient NTQ scores, the network's distributed intelligence will allocate the node to suitable state channels.</p>
<p>The network-level definition of a node is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">
// Node represents a host on the network.
// The fields of Node may not be modified.
type Node struct {
    IP       net.IP // len 4 for IPv4 or 16 for IPv6
    UDP, TCP uint16 // port numbers
    ID       NodeID // the node's public key

    RaftPort uint16

    // This is a cached copy of sha3(ID) which is used for node
    // distance calculations. This is part of Node in order to make it
    // possible to write tests that need a node at a certain distance.
    // In those tests, the content of sha will not actually correspond
    // with ID.
    sha common.Hash

    // whether this node is currently being pinged in order to replace
    // it in a bucket
    contested bool

}

var NodeRoleMap map[common.Hash]uint
var NodeStateMap map[common.Hash]uint

</code></pre>
<p>where, the <code>NodeStateMap</code> and <code>NodeRoleMap</code> are dynamic mappings used to refer to the nature of the nodes by the sha3<sup><a href="#references">[10]</a></sup> of their Node ID. The mappings are instrumental in identifying the nature of nodes during DHT lookups<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The decision to route the transport of information is made based on the Kademlia's<sup><a href="#references">[12]</a></sup> bucket lookups. In KIP network, nodes are required to persist three k-buckets with each bucket's size limiting to, but not limited to 16 with a concurrency factor of 3, to facilitate operations across all buckets corresponding to lookups among Master Nodes, Star Nodes &amp; Service Nodes respectively.</p>
<p>Distance between the target is compared as followed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// distcmp compares the distances a-&gt;target and b-&gt;target.
// Returns -1 if a is closer to target, 1 if b is closer to target
// and 0 if they are equal.
func distcmp(target, a, b common.Hash) int {
    if(NodeRoleMap[target] == NodeRoleMap[a] == NodeRoleMap[b])
    {
        for i := range target {
            da := a[i] ^ target[i]

<p>The state channels hosted by the grand nodes &amp; star nodes are facilitated by an actor concurrency model consisting of hybrid <code>mutex</code> &amp; <code>chan</code> spaces across the network.

<p>Blockchains could not only be used to secure integrity and achieve transparency, but also harness the intents to create values. Although a few blockchain platforms offer the means to capture and relay the transactional metadata, the mechanisms to aggregate and refer to the same in an ubiquitous manner is seldom practised.</p>
<p>KIP introduces the TDU factor by leveraging the application of <em>Interaction vectors</em> - the hybrid information vectors setup to source the background of a given transaction. A commercial transaction to purchase goods/service online can be motivated by several factors. The level of transparency introduced by the blockchain enables the information vectors to be categorized into 3 basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Identity vectors:</em> This is a fundamental vector used to identifying the KIP wallet account responsible for the transaction. In both cases of either a PUSH or PULL transaction, the sender &amp; the recipient address are attributed to <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> keys respectively. The from &amp; to attributes can be of any nature - managed by an individual owner OR a smart contract managed by external users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Causal vectors:</em> This fundamental vector is used to capture the intent behind a transaction. The attribution of the reason or the cause to initiate a purchase transaction of commodity, relative to a timeline in efforts, could be of incremental value to enterprises. The circumstances influencing the decision to initiate the transaction is attributed in the causal vector &amp; hence the content is fairly dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Method vectors:</em> This fundamental vector is a continuation to the efforts of the causal vectors. Each transaction propagated in the KIP network is a payload attributed with timestamp, nonce, fee &amp; associated asset class at any given time. The means to achieve the fulfillment &amp; finality of the transactions are the typical attributes of this vector. The conditions influencing the decision to initiate the transaction is attributed in the causal vector &amp; hence the content is fairly dynamic.</p>

<p>The microscopic attributes are aggregated by account type &amp; id, at the end of specified number of epochs.</p>

<p>Platform fee is not just the cost of computational operations but also represents an economic interest to protect the system from sybil attackers by levying a specific cost to achieve determined output. KIP's platform fee &amp; the incentivization model is also developed around similar thinking. However, KIP offers absolute ease and a new efficient method that overcomes a few limitations in the former.</p>
<p>KIP offers the user to select the execution tier, upon which the platform fee shall be calculated. The concept of tier-based execution is introduced to address the unnecessity involved in executing a signed transaction of relatively lower importance / asset value across the entire network. This is made possible by using KIP's state channels hosted by interested consortium members on various types of hardware(collectively called the &quot;Tier&quot;). The cost associated with executing the instructions among the subset of nodes forming the state channel is calculated. Similarly, the to transmit the formally verified &amp; processed information is added to the fee.</p>

<p>The total computed cost is transmitted back to the user for approval. In contrast to the variable balance between the <code>gasLimit</code> allowed and the <code>gasPrice</code> that can be set by the user in former, KIP understands the nature of enterprise permissioned networks in the form of superset of state channels distributed in clusters. The balance is now achieved by maintaining an inherent scale of gasPrice that can be varied against changes in the cost to maintain the hardware corresponding to respective tiers. More on the tier-based cost balancing mentioned in the Stable Gas Cost section.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 10:</strong> Nodes support <code>UPDATE</code> operation by updating the content of the file with a new entry to the Merkle DAG with the new supplied content queried by its KFS file identifier</p>
<p><strong>STEP 11:</strong> Nodes support <code>DELETE</code> operation by deleting the content of the file and removing the leaf of the Merkle DAG and updating the path</p>

<p>KFS is designed in an effective manner to support the persistence &amp; operation of large volumes of Big Data.</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Fig 20:</b> KFS - Sharding Approach <sup><a href="#references"></a></sup> </p>
<p>This is made possible by integrating our file system with HDFS<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup> at a fundamental, a highly scalable filesystem for copious amount of Big Data. The native interface is established to create, read, update &amp; delete the information between shared between internal big data file systems and respective KFS network.</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Fig 21:</b> KFS Data Interface with Leypa <sup><a href="#references"></a></sup> </p>
<p>KIP offers a native ability to integrate the diApps to KFS and other storage realms through Leypa, a web3-like integration library supporting both mobile &amp; web applications deriving functionalities from diApps.</p>
<p>More on Leypa specified at <a href="/pages/specs/kide/kide-specs.html">KIDE &amp; Krama Services Specs</a> document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Permissioned CRUD Operations - Formal Notation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong>  User initiates the transaction by signing with the KIP account private key</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Transaction is wrapped up with nonce, platform fee, data, value, tier and specific KFS Cluster ID by diApp</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong>  The diApp will transfer the user's request through Leypa to Krama Service Interface</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> When the user request to <code>CREATE</code> a file on KFS, Leypa transports the payload to KSI orchestration network and requests to store on specified KFS cluster, returning its <code>KFS file identifier</code> on successful write operation</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong> When the user request to <code>READ</code> a KFS file by its <code>KFS file identifier</code>, Leypa transports the request to KFS for lookup by the given ID. Successful lookup returns the content of the file, else returns an error message with appropriate code</p>
<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong> When the user request to <code>UPDATE</code> a KFS file by its <code>KFS file identifier</code> along with the new content, Leypa transports the new payload to be updated and requests for lookup by the given file identifier and update the new content to the file. Successful update returns the new hash else returns an error message with appropriate code</p>
<p><strong>STEP 7:</strong>
When the user request to <code>DELETE</code> an existing KFS file with a <code>KFS file identifier</code>, Leypa transports the command to KSI which requests KFS to lookup by the given ID . Successful lookup will delete the content of file, remove the Merkle DAG leaf and update the path, else returns an error message with appropriate code</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Fig 22:</b> Analytics & AI Practices on KFS <sup><a href="#references"></a></sup> </p>
<p>Large amounts of transactional raw data as well as structured information can be stored in KFS for performing analytical processing. Krama Cognitive Services offer multi-level heterogenous integration with Machine Learning Algorithms, Neural Networks, Expert Systems &amp; other AI-based models etc.</p>
<a class="header" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p>We propose an efficient system &amp; underlying methods that establish distributed intelligence with big data persistence, scalability, maximized throughput &amp; predictable TCO by various approaches to orchestrate, partition, arrange and pass messages in a deterministic manner, thereby encouraging businesses to adopt a minimalistic approach to obtain exponential scaling on various range of computational devices; accompanied by capturing values, and attribute them to respective transactions propagated by actors in the network.</p>
